# Data Required from States

This document outlines Southwick data needs for the National/Regional dashboard. Each data pull should include all stand-alone license records for the given time period. These records should be sufficient to identify ALL licensed anglers and hunters (i.e., all annual, lifetime, multi-year, short-term, and combination hunting/fishing licenses). See [Database Schemas](data-schema.md) for details about how these are to be standardized on the Southwick Server.

**Date Range**: Calendar years 2010-2019 (sales from Jan 1, 2010 thru Dec 31, 2019)

## Data Format

The raw data are typically separated into 3 related tables in delimited plain text files (alternative data structures are okay, but a related format is preferred because it reduces data duplication and total file size):

1.	License Sales (i.e., transactions): One row per license purchase
2.	Customers: One row per customer
3.	License Types (i.e., products): One row per license type

## Data Fields

Each data table should contain data fields (columns) sufficient to identify the characteristics of interest. The "primary key" refers to a column that uniquely identifies rows in a table, whereas "foreign key" refers to a column that provides a relational join to another table.

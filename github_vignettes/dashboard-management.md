# Dashboard Management

Might be worthwhile to include some basic info about managing dashboard projects here. 

## State Sharing

Include the O365 links to documentation provided to state agencies

## Individual State Dashboards

We use [package sadash](https://github.com/southwick-associates/sadash) for the more-involved individual state dashboards. I need to update/improve the documentation for that workflow.
